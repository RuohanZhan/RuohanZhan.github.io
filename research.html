      <div class="pub_title">Data-driven Option Pricing with Shape Constraints
		</div>
      <h2>with Zheng Gong, advised by Prof. Zuowei Shen and Prof. Steven Kou. 09/2016-present</h2>
      <p>In this project, we try to approximate the true option pricing function based on observed variables.
          Mathematically, we firstly use B-spline basis to approximate a two-dimensional function(option price with respect to 
          strike and time to maturity)
          with shape constraint(monotonically decreasing and convexity in strike). Wavelet tight frames are used to transform this continuous setting 
        into a discrete setting. Then we fit wavelet coefficients to computationally-practically extrapolate
          it to a three-dimensional
 case, with the integration of stock price, to satisfy online data processing. Experiments on historical data shows our method's
        abilities for more accurate estimation and less overfitting than previous model.</p>

      <div class="pub_title"> Adaptive Interpolation for Marginal Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Stochastic Volatility Model

		</div>
      <h2>Undergraduate thesis, advised by Prof. Chenxu Li. 03/2017-06/2017</h2>
      <p>For marginal maximum loglikelihood estimation, we need to 
          estimate corresponding loglikelihood with given model parameters
          in the search path. My advisor Professor Chenxu Li developed a recurrence
          algorithm to solve it efficiently, and one major problem is to expand marginal 
          functions under piecewise cubic polynomial basis. This thesis proposes 
          an adaptive grid selecting algorithm to choose segment points in the density expansion.
          We firstly determine the grid range based on the stationary distribution, then the 
          grid density according to the uniform approximation precision. In the numerical experiments, 
          we explore how to choose the algorithm thresholds, and also testify its 
          convergence and ability to find smooth local minimum in various simulation paths.</p>

      <p>In this project, we propose a spatial-Radon domain CT image
		  reconstruction model based on data-driven tight frames (SRD-DDTF). 
		  The proposed SRD-DDTF model combines the idea of joint image and Radon domain inpainting model 
		   and that of the data-driven tight frames for image denoising. 
		  It is different from existing models in that both CT image and 
		  ts corresponding high quality projection image are reconstructed simultaneously 
		  using sparsity priors by tight frames that are adaptively learned from the data 
		  to provide optimal sparse approximations. An alternative minimization algorithm 
		  is designed to solve the proposed model which is nonsmooth and nonconvex. Convergence 
		  analysis of the algorithm is provided. Numerical experiments showed that the SRD-DDTF model 
		  is superior to the previous model especially in recovering some subtle structures in the images.</p>

      <div class="pub_title">De-reflection via Two Wavelet Systems <a href="https://github.com/RuohanZhan/SRD-DDTF"> Code</a></div>
      <h2>Ruohan Zhan, mentored by Prof. Zuowei Shen and Prof. Hui Ji. 09/2016-10/2016 </h2>
      <p>Layer separation for images taken through window is an under-determined problem, 
		  which is hard to solve especially in the ambiguity in low frequency layers. 
		  Ghosting phenomenon breaks symmetry in two layers, 
		  but could cause displacement for replicate patterns and edges in the similar direction 
		  with ghosting kernel. In this project, we propose a two-wavelet-system approach 
		  to achieve both low-frequency part separation and edge preservation.
		  The first wavelet system is to decompose image into low-frequency part 
		  and high-frequency part, and the second wavelet system is to facilitate low-frequency separation. 
		  We then put up with a two-stage approximation algorithm based on variable splitting 
		  to solve our model. Further analysis on the algorithm gives insights to the ill-posed
		  layer separation problem that high-pass wavelet enhancement could largely contribute
		  to low-frequency regularization due to the redundancy of wavelet system. 
		  Numerical experiments on real world data show that our approach could achieve
		  comparable de-reflection results with previous methods, and notably better preserve edges 
		  in IT . Besides, our approach is more computational efficient due to the fast linear wavelet transformation.

      <p>Our work focuses on applying machine learning methods 
		  to facilitating echocardiographic diagnosis. Firstly, Non-negative 
		  Matrix Factorization(NMF) is used to extract low dimensional representation 
		  of video frames. Biographically meaningful end-members are produced and used 
		  to select end-systolic and end-diastolic frames of cardiac cycle. Cardiac period 
		  is estimated based on the analysis of NMF coefficients, followed by a video decomposition 
		  to capture different features of heart motion. Numerical results show that our method is more accurate
		  and more operable than previous manifold learning methods.

    Neural Network TrainingSplit
		  <a href="https://github.com/RuohanZhan/Neural-Network-Algorithm/tree/master/notes">[Notes]</a>

      <h2>Ruohan Zhan, discussed with Prof. Stanley Osher, Prof. Yuan Yao and Prof. Wotao Yin. 07/2016-09/2016</h2>
      <p>With the advent of big data era, neural network, as a powerful
    data learning tool, has drawn increasing attention, leading to the
    upsurge of researches on how to tune it effectively and efficiently.
    Traditional methods as back propagation suffer from saturation
    effects(known as vanishing gradients), especially dealing with deep neural
    networks. In this project, we study an up-to-date tuning method, that
    is, to apply split bregman iteration to solving an optimisation model
    with equality constraints. Numerical results show its tuning efficiency
    as well as the ability of avoiding saturation. Our work furthermore
    extends it to linearized split bregman iteration, which has shown the
    potential of being more computationally scalable due to the drop of
    inverse calculation by preliminary results.
